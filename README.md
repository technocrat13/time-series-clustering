# time-series-clustering
K-Nearest Neighbor, and hierarchical clustering approach to Time Series Clustering on Stock data:
- The data is an unlabeled collection of daily variations for a singular stock logged every minute
- There are 277 days worth of data and 1440 data points, corresponding to one observation every minute
- All days have an equal number of data (1440) and no data point is absent

Here is the given data after cleaning

## Generated clusters
Do checkout the [indepth python notebook](/time_series_clustering.pdf) for the steps and logic behind those steps taken to perform this task
